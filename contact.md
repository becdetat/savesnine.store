Saves Nine prefers to work from a portfolio of designs and quality materials, so custom commissions are not generally accepted. However, if you see something that you like, please get in touch with Charmaine to talk about the design and help decide on the best materials to work with.

Save Nine's work is also displayed for sale at [Long Shot Coffee Stop](https://www.facebook.com/people/Long-Shot-Coffee-Stop/100076074286884), at the Bondoola Golf Driving Range just outside of Yeppoon. Some of Charmaine's finest work is presented at this charming coffee shop, and EFTPOS is available.
